# The Catâ„¢

It follows your cursor around. Can also lick his paw, clean his ear and sleep super hard. Press SHIFT to make it run faster!

## TODOs

- [ ] Maybe some better UI, CSS
- [ ] The focus point of cat is in top-left corner of the sprite, which looks bad if cursor is on the right. Can this be solved (without going crazy)?
- [ ] Maybe add some extra things for cat / user to do, like giving cat food or having some birds flying around
